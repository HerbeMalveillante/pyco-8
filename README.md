pyco-8 is a game engine based on Pygame, enabling the creation of little games with an API similar to the fantasy console Pico-8, with the Python programming language.

The goal was to solve three problems that people could have with pico-8 :

- It's paid, and you can't use it for free.
- It uses the Lua programming language
- It has limitations. I understand it's the principal interest of fantasy consoles, but you might want to program using the style of pico-8, without it's limitations.

This way, I've been recoding the engine in Python, and I hope it will be useful for you.

For now, it does not have a Graphical User Interface, and I don't support all the features of pico-8 yet (sprites, map, sounds, etc).

In the future, the goal is to create a graphical user interface, and all the features of pico-8, so that you can easily create games with the same simplicity of pico-8, but with way more flexibility, external librairies, multiplayer, save states, etc.
